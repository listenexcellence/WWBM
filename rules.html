    <h1>Rules of the Game Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - Emplace College</h1>
    <div class="rule">
      <p>
        Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - Emplace College is a quiz competition where
        contestants have to correctly answer a series of multiple-choice
        questions in order to advance to the next level / question. There are 15
        questions in total and each question is worth a specific amount of money
        and no time limit is placed on contestants to come up with an answer.
        Contestants also get three Lifelines to assist them if they get stuck on
        a particular question.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Who Wants to Be a Millionaire questions are structured according to
        five different Levels with each level increasing in difficulty. Each
        level contains three questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s important to remember that the questions which make up each level
        will not necessarily relate to the same or even similar topics, but
        their overall level of difficulty will be the same. Also note that the
        question Levels should not be confused with the Safe Havens or the
        Question Value Structure that are both explained below.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three ‘safe havens’ in the question structure (Questions five,
        ten and fifteen). Contestants accumulate money with each correct answer,
        but should they then answer incorrectly before reaching a safe haven,
        they stand to lose a large amount of winnings. Below is a summary of the
        question value structure:
      </p>

      <h1>Lifelines</h1>
      <p>
        Contestants are allowed three Lifelines that they can use at any point
        during the game. Each Lifeline can only be used once.
      </p>

      <p>
        50/50 – removes two wrong answers from the multiple-choice selection,
        leaving the contestant with only one correct and one incorrect option.
        This means they have a 50/50 chance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ask the Audience – the audience is asked the same question as the
        contestant and a quick poll is done to show their answers. If the chart
        shows a clear majority for a specific answer, this Lifeline can be
        extremely helpful, but it’s still up to the contestant whether or not to
        go with the results obtained from the audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Phone a Friend – Contestants are allowed to make a 30-second call to a
        friend or family member and ask them if they know the answer to the
        question.
